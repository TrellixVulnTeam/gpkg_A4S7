Goals
    1) To install a package to a package-specific user

    2) /home of package-specific user will contain a copy
    of the tarball, build script, package-locations file and package info

    3) Be able to list all the files of a program by listing the files owned
    by the package-specific user

    4) Being able to remove a file in complete as well as any unused dependancies 

    5) Output an end message containing notes on any irregularities during installation

    6) Execute an initial setup script that will:
        a) Create install group
        b) Give install permissions to group of install folders

Notes
    1) Dependancies must be installed before a package is installed

Commands:

    Clean   :: cleans out unused dependancies

Process
    A) Installation Process
        1) Ensure command has been given root permissions
        2) Create package-specific user
        3) Give package-specific user proper file-overwrite permissions
        4) Untar tarball
        5) Run pre.sh
        6) cd into tarball
        7) Switch to package-specific user
        8) Run package install script
        9) Switch back to root
        10) Run post.sh
        11) Exit process
